    title: Career Summary
    summary: |
      A Technical Architect specialising in building world class 'Well Architected' Cloud Native products and services.  A budding strategist, highly skilled in many software and product delivery methods such as Lean, Agile, Exploratory and Continuous Delivery. 
      A strong advocate of product over project skilled in product management. Values humility, empathy, integrity and believes in the power of investing in people and the 
      principles of XP (communication, feedback, simplicity, respect and courage).

      For the last eight years I have specialised in supporting organisations and teams modernise workloads from traditional n-tiered architecture to modern cloud implementations.
      During this period I operated in roles such as Solutions Architect, Technical and Software Architect, Engineer, Product Owner and Technical & Business Coach, overcoming significant technical and organisational challenges along the way.
      As well as developing core architectural skills for the serverless paradigm I have also really enjoyed developing my leadership and strategy consultancy skills such as Wardley Maps, Strategy Cycles, Event Storming and North Stars Playbook.
      Using these skills in bringing IT and Engineering and the Business together has helped me progress in building productive relationships solidified through great business outcomes.  I have been active in the local and global communities sharing my experience
      in the hope that i can help and learn from others.  In 2022 I was a co-author of the book The Value Flywheel Effect which published by IT Revolution and has been warmly received by the Global Engineering community.
